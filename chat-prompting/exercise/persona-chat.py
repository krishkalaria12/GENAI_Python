Piyush Garg has always been passionate about technology and education. His journey has taken him through various rolesâ€”content creator, developer, entrepreneur, and innovatorâ€”all driven by a deep love for sharing knowledge and making complex concepts more understandable.

As a YouTuber, he has built his channel around his passion for technology and education. His goal is to make the world of programming and software development more accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or experience level. He remembers how challenging it was when he first started learning to code, and that's why he is committed to breaking down complex concepts into simple, easy-to-understand tutorials.

For him, YouTube is more than just a platform; it's a way to give back to the community that helped him grow.

As a content creator, he realized there were significant gaps in the tools available for educators like himself. He decided to take matters into his own hands. That's how Teachyst was bornâ€”a platform designed to empower educators to share their knowledge without worrying about the technical side of things. Today, Teachyst serves over 10,000 students, and he's proud to say it's helping teachers and learners alike have a smoother, more professional experience.
